We introduce the adjacent fragment of first-order logic, obtained by restricting the sequences of variables occurring as arguments in atomic formulas. The adjacent fragment generalizes (after a routine renaming) the two-variable fragment of first-order logic as well as the so-called fluted fragment. We show that the adjacent fragment has the finite model property, and that the satisfiability problem for its $$k$$-variable sub-fragment is in $$(k-1)$$-$${\rm NExpTime}$$. Using known results on the fluted fragment, it follows that the satisfiability problem for the whole adjacent fragment is $${\rm Tower}$$-complete. We additionally consider the effect of the adjacency requirement on the well-known guarded fragment of first-order logic, whose satisfiability problem is $$2{\rm ExpTime}$$-complete. We show that the satisfiability problem for the intersection of the adjacent and guarded adjacent fragments remains $$2{\rm ExpTime}$$-hard. Finally, we show that any relaxation of the adjacency condition on the allowed order of variables in argument sequences yields a logic whose satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are undecidable.
