We give a decision procedure for the satisfiability problem of the Ackermann fragment with equality, when the number of trailing existential quantifiers is bounded by some fixed integer m, and thus establish an $${\rm ExpTime}$$ upper-bound. Taking the work of R. Jaakkoa into account, we conclude that any Ackermann (sub-)fragment must feature at least two leading as well as an unbounded number of trailing existential quantifiers to retain $${\rm NExpTime}$$-hardness.
